Great! Weâ€™ll build Raft step by step in Golang. Hereâ€™s the high-level plan:

ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Raft Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Basics of Raft

âœ… Step 1: Define the Raft Node Structure (terms, logs, state)
âœ… Step 2: Implement Leader Election
âœ… Step 3: Implement Log Replication

Phase 2: Making It Robust

âœ… Step 4: Implement Commit & Apply Logs
âœ… Step 5: Implement Leader Change (Failover Handling)

Phase 3: Real-World Integration

âœ… Step 6: Add Networking (gRPC or ConnectRPC)
âœ… Step 7: Implement Persistence (disk storage for logs)
âœ… Step 8: Optimize Performance (batching, snapshotting)

ðŸ”¥ Step 1: Define Raft Node Structure

Weâ€™ll start by defining the Raft node structure in Golang.
Each node will have:
	â€¢	Persistent State (term, log entries, votedFor)
	â€¢	Volatile State (commit index, leader info)
	â€¢	RPC Methods for election & log replication

Step 1 Code: Basic Raft Node

Hereâ€™s the starting point:

```go

package raft

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

const (
	Follower  = "follower"
	Candidate = "candidate"
	Leader    = "leader"
)

// LogEntry represents a command in the log
type LogEntry struct {
	Term    int    // Term when entry was received
	Command string // Command (in real systems, this could be any state machine command)
}

// RaftNode represents a single Raft node
type RaftNode struct {
	mu        sync.Mutex
	id        int       // Node ID
	peers     []int     // List of peer node IDs
	state     string    // Current state (Follower, Candidate, Leader)
	currentTerm int      // Latest term seen
	votedFor   *int      // Candidate voted for in current term
	log       []LogEntry // Log entries
	commitIndex int      // Highest log entry known to be committed
	lastApplied int      // Last applied log index

	// Volatile state for leader
	nextIndex  map[int]int // Next log index to send to each follower
	matchIndex map[int]int // Highest log index replicated on each follower

	electionTimer  *time.Timer
	heartbeatTimer *time.Timer
}
```

Next Step: Leader Election

Now that we have the basic structure, weâ€™ll implement Leader Election in Step 2.

Do you want to proceed with election timers and voting logic next? ðŸš€
