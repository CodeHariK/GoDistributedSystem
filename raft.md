Yes, you can send a message to any Raft node, but only the leader can process writes. Here’s how it works:

How Raft Handles Client Requests
	1.	A node (follower or leader) receives a message.
	2.	If the node is the leader, it processes the message immediately:
	•	Assigns a monotonic ID and timestamp.
	•	Replicates the message to Raft followers.
	•	Once a quorum (majority) confirms, the message is committed.
	•	The leader returns the verified message with a token to the sender.
	3.	If the node is a follower, it:
	•	Redirects the request to the leader (this adds some latency).
	•	The leader handles the request as above.

Optimizing Direct Writes to Any Node

To avoid the overhead of redirection, you can:
	•	Use a Load Balancer to send requests directly to the leader.
	•	Let Nodes Cache the Leader Info so they send writes directly.
	•	Auto-Detect Leader Changes using Raft’s “Leader Hints” in responses.

Gossiping After Raft Consensus

Once a message is committed in Raft:
	•	The sender node gossips the verified message (with ID, timestamp, token).
	•	Other gossip nodes verify and forward it.




Simply sending a message to all replicas without a consensus protocol leads to inconsistencies and data divergence. Here’s why Raft (or similar protocols) is needed instead of just broadcasting updates to all replicas:

Problems Without Consensus (Naïve Replication)

If you just send a message to all 10 replicas without Raft, you run into major problems:
	1.	No Global Ordering
	•	Nodes may receive messages in different orders due to network delays.
	•	Example: Replica 1 sees UPDATE x = 10, then UPDATE x = 20, but Replica 2 sees the reverse.
	•	Now different replicas have different values for x!
	2.	Partial Writes & Failures
	•	If 10 replicas exist and you send an update, what if some fail to receive it?
	•	Now some nodes have old data, while others have new data—breaking consistency.
	3.	Split-Brain Problem
	•	If there’s a network partition, some replicas may accept one version of a write while others accept a different version.
	•	After the network is restored, there’s no way to know which version is correct!

How Raft Solves These Problems

Raft (or Paxos, EPaxos) ensures strong consistency by:
✅ Choosing a leader that orders all writes.
✅ Ensuring all replicas apply writes in the same order.
✅ Waiting for a quorum (majority) before committing to avoid split-brain.
✅ Automatically electing a new leader if the current one fails.

Example: 10 Replicas Using Raft
	1.	A client sends UPDATE x = 10 to any node.
	2.	That node forwards it to the Raft leader.
	3.	The leader assigns a log index (ordering the write).
	4.	The leader replicates the log entry to at least 5 out of 10 nodes (quorum).
	5.	Once a quorum acknowledges, the write is committed and applied to all nodes.
	6.	Even if some replicas fail, the system maintains consistency.




In Raft, if two nodes receive different messages at the same time, the leader is responsible for determining the order. Here’s how Raft handles it:

⸻

Scenario: Two Nodes Propose Messages at the Same Time
	1.	Only the Leader Can Commit Entries
	•	If two nodes propose messages, they must send them to the Raft leader.
	•	The leader is the single authority responsible for ordering messages.
	2.	Leader Assigns a Log Index
	•	The leader assigns each message a log index (e.g., Log[5], Log[6]).
	•	Even if two nodes propose at the same time, the leader serializes them.
	•	Example:
	•	Node A proposes SET x = 10 → Leader assigns Log[5]
	•	Node B proposes SET x = 20 → Leader assigns Log[6]
	3.	Leader Replicates in Order
	•	The leader sends the ordered log entries to followers.
	•	Followers apply logs in the exact order assigned by the leader.
	4.	Consensus (Quorum) Before Commit
	•	Once a majority (quorum) acknowledges a log entry, it is committed.
	•	If Node A’s proposal reaches quorum first, it commits before Node B’s.

⸻

What If There’s a Leader Election During This?
	•	If a leader crashes before committing, a new leader is elected.
	•	The new leader ensures log consistency:
	•	If a follower has an uncommitted log entry, it may be rolled back.
	•	Only logs that were replicated to a quorum survive.

Key Takeaways

✅ Raft always has a single leader ordering writes.
✅ Even simultaneous proposals must go through the leader.
✅ Log index ensures strict global ordering.
