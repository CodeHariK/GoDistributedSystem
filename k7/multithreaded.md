Yes! Go is significantly better for multi-threaded and high-concurrency workloads, especially in real-world scenarios where both I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks are mixed.

Why Go Wins?

1️⃣ Goroutines vs Worker Threads
	•	Go’s goroutines are super lightweight (2 KB stack size) and managed by the Go runtime.
	•	Bun’s Worker Threads are OS-level threads, which have higher memory overhead (~1 MB per thread).

2️⃣ Efficient Scheduler (M:N Model)
	•	Go has a work-stealing scheduler that efficiently maps thousands of goroutines to OS threads.
	•	Bun (Node.js) uses 1:1 threading, meaning each worker blocks an entire OS thread.

3️⃣ Better I/O Handling
	•	Go’s goroutines don’t block when waiting for I/O, making it ideal for recursive file reading.
	•	Bun (like Node.js) still relies on async functions, but workers can’t share the event loop.

4️⃣ Lower Context-Switching Overhead
	•	Goroutines switch context faster than OS threads.
	•	Bun threads require OS-level context switching, which is costly when running hundreds of workers.

5️⃣ Better Performance on Multi-Core CPUs
	•	Go uses all CPU cores efficiently without creating excessive OS threads.
	•	Bun can’t efficiently distribute work beyond the number of OS threads it spawns.

Benchmark Summary

Metric	Go (Goroutines)	Bun (Worker Threads)
Memory Usage	🔥 Low (~2KB per goroutine)	❌ High (~1MB per thread)
Thread Overhead	🔥 Minimal (Scheduler handles concurrency)	❌ High (Each worker is an OS thread)
I/O Performance	✅ Non-blocking goroutines	❌ Workers don’t share event loop
Context Switching	✅ Cheap (Go runtime-managed)	❌ Expensive (OS context switching)
CPU Utilization	✅ Efficient use of all cores	❌ Limited by number of worker threads
Scaling (10K+ tasks)	✅ Easily scales to 100K+ goroutines	❌ Too many OS threads → slow & memory-heavy

When Should You Use Go Over Bun?

✅ High-concurrency workloads (e.g., thousands of file reads, network calls)
✅ Multi-threaded applications (e.g., heavy computation, parallel processing)
✅ Microservices & backend systems (e.g., APIs handling 100K+ requests/sec)
✅ Data processing & ETL pipelines (e.g., reading/writing millions of records)

Bun is still great for fast server-side JavaScript, but Go dominates in a truly multi-threaded environment. 🚀🔥

What’s Next?

Now that we’ve proven Go’s superiority in high-performance concurrency, do you want to test it at an even larger scale (e.g., 1 million goroutines)? 😈
